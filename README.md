# Style Sheet Generator

This software generates a QT style sheet based on the following two software components:
- Paletton (https://paletton.com/)
- Breeze Style Sheet (https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/BreezeStyleSheets)

From Paletton, you can define a 3-color based template and export it as a .txt file.
This then can be merged either with one of the by SSG provided templates:
- dark.template
- light.template

Last but not least, you have to specify an output directory, where your custom QSS file will be written to.

This file then can be used for creating a QT conform asset.
